# SSML Practice Files

This folder is for your SSML code and syntax experiments.

- Create `.xml` or `.txt` files here to write SSML snippets.
- You can also add Python scripts to process your SSML files.

Example file names:
- `example1.ssml.xml`
- `test-pause.ssml.txt`
- `speak.py` (for Python scripts)

Feel free to organize as you like!
